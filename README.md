# WNAB Backend (Spring Boot)
This project was meant to learn more about backend development while building something that I would actually use, You Need A Budget (YNAB). Since it's open source, I thought We Need A Budget (WNAB) would be pretty fitting.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- AWS Lambda
- AWS RDS
- AWS API Gateway

### Will be deployed soon!
