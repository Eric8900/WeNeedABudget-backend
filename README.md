# WNAB Backend (Spring Boot)
This project was meant to learn more about backend development while building something that I would actually use, You Need A Budget (YNAB). Since it's open source, I thought We Need A Budget (WNAB) would be pretty fitting.

## Functionality
WNAB is a CRUD budgeting app for creating smart budgets where every dollar of your account is allocated to some meaningful category of your life.

- RESTful CRUD function endpoints for each table of the database (see database structure below)
- Email and Password authentication using JWT tokens
- OAuth authentication with Google

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- JWT + OAuth
- AWS RDS
- AWS EC2 maybe
- ~AWS Lambda~
- ~AWS API Gateway~
